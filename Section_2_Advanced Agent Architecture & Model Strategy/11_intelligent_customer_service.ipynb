    "\n",
    "In this hands-on project, you'll build an intelligent customer service platform that demonstrates all the key concepts from Section 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Architecture (Lecture 6):** Multiple specialized agents with different capabilities\n",
    "- **Model Selection (Lecture 7):** Intelligent routing based on complexity and cost\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering (Lecture 8):** Different prompt patterns for different agent types\n",
    "- **Agent Types (Lecture 9):** Practical application of agent selection criteria\n",
    "- **Professional Workflows (Lecture 10):** Clean, maintainable code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "- 4 specialized customer service agents with different personalities\n",
    "- Intelligent ticket routing based on content and customer tier\n",
    "- Multiple prompt engineering patterns in action\n",
    "- Cost-optimized model selection for different agent types\n",
    "- Professional code structure with proper testing\n",
